                <ul>
                    <li>All members of the household must be present to adopt a dog.</li>

                    <li>If you are planning on adopting a dog, you must bring any dogs that now live in the household for a later visit so we can introduce them to make sure they are compatible.</li>

                    <li>It’s a good idea to bring veterinary records of current pets.</li>

                    <li>All cats must be transported in a cat carrier. You may purchase a cardboard carrier at the shelter if you do not have one.</li>

    {
        question: 'Are there any obligations after the adoption?',
        answer: <p>Having a companion animal brings rewards and responsibilities. Following your pet’s adoption, you will be responsible for making sure your pet is safe and for providing regular veterinary care. Be sure your dog has appropriate identification. Provide nutritious food and fresh water for your pet. Make time for exercise, training, and play. Finally, enjoy your new life with your new loving companion.</p>

        answer: <p>We understand that after you get our pet home, the adjustment period can be difficult. We encourage you to call us with any questions or problems, hopefully, before small problems become big ones! We are very experienced with pet transitions and welcome the opportunity to help make it as smooth for you and your pet as possible. And even when all is going well, we love getting calls just to know how our “alumni” are doing.</p>

    {
        question: 'Why Should I Foster A Cat Or A Dog?',
        answer: <p>As a foster parent, you will be able to love, care for, and enjoy knowing different cats and dogs. And you will be doing a wonderful thing – giving these deserving animals a chance at a new life.</p>

    },

    {
        question: 'Will The Animal Be Healthy?',
        answer: <p>All of our animals are vet checked, spayed or neutered (or soon will be), current on all vaccinations, microchipped, tested for worms and parasites and treated as needed, and dogs are tested for heartworm and are on preventative. We will tell you if an animal has a health problem and together evaluate whether or not an animal with medical needs is a good choice for you.</p>
    },

    {
        question: 'What Are The Benefits Of Fostering A Cat Or A Dog?',
        answer: <p>We will inform you of the animals in need of foster homes, and you will be able to express your preference. We will set you up as a foster home if we believe the animal is a good fit for your home. We make every effort to match you with an animal that fits your lifestyle. If you live in an apartment, you can request an elderly, low-energy animal or a cat or dog that is recovering from medical treatment and needs to be kept quiet. If your family is active, you can request a dog that requires frequent walks and exercise. If someone in your family is used to working with dogs, they can assist with basic obedience training or teach him some tricks.</p>
    },
    {
        question: 'If I Already Have A Pet, What Should I Do?',
        answer: <p>If you already have a cat or dog, that's fine in most circumstances, as long as your pet and the foster pet are both healthy and well behaved around other animals. If you're fostering kittens, they'll need to be housed in a different room from the rest of your animals. Prior to arranging any foster home, an introduction between your current animals and the animal we need to foster will be made to ensure that the animal will be a good fit for the entire family.</p>
    },
    {
        question: 'How Long Do Animals Remain in Foster Care?',
        answer: <p>The length of time a cat or dog spends in foster care varies based on the animal's needs. Special-needs animals may need to be in foster care for several months. Some people may only stay for a few days. It all depends on the situation of the individual cat or dog.</p>
    },
    {
        question: 'Do I Have To Stay At Home All Day With The Animal?',
        answer: <p>Certainly not. Many foster parents work outside the home but still provide a loving environment for the cat or dog. We do require that the foster animal be confined to a small, secure place, preferably a training crate, whenever you are unable to closely watch them. A small space, such as a bathroom or bedroom, is preferable for cats or kittens to stay in while you're away. This provides a safe and secure environment for your cat and dog, as well as protecting your home and belongings.</p>
    },
    {
        question: 'Is it necessary for me to have a fenced yard in order to foster a dog?',
        answer: <p>It is preferable, but not necessary, to have a fenced yard. Foster pets should never be let out on their own. The dog may be exercised off leash in your yard if it is surrounded by a secure fence. Outside of the yard, the dog must always be on a leash.</p>
    },
    {
        question: 'What Should I Do If I am Having Issues?',
        answer: <p>Telephone consultations are offered with members of the staff. Fostering children is highly fulfilling. However, keep in mind that many rescue animals, but not all, are housebroken or have had little socialization or obedience training. When given the opportunity, these animals not only improve, but thrive in their foster care setting.</p>
    },
    {
        question: 'What if I want to go somewhere?',
        answer: <p>'If you're fostering and want to go away for the weekend or vacation, the foster cat or dog can be left in the care of the coordinator while you're gone. Just let us know as soon as you know, and we'll save you a seat.'</p>
    },
    {
        question: 'Will My Foster Pet Become Attached To Me?',
        answer: <p>Without a doubt. However, you will be more than happy to see your foster pet move on to his new life once he finds a new family who is ready to offer him with a permanent loving home.</p>
