            <p>In general, having a pet disaster plan is a smart idea, but you'll want to take a few extra precautions with the COVID-19. Here's how to make a pet emergency preparedness plan, what to keep on hand at all times, and what to do if you or a family member becomes ill. </p>
            <h3>Getting your pet ready in case of an emergency:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Check your pet's vaccines and health records to make sure they're up to date.</li>
                <li>Make sure your pet has at least two pieces of identification on his or her collar, such as a microchip and a tag with your contact information.</li>
                <li>Double-check that your pet's contact information is accurate and up-to-date.</li>
                <li>Take a recent photo of your pet to keep on hand in case he or she becomes separated from you.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>What you should have on hand:</h2>
            <p>Pack a kit that you can easily access if necessary and that you can easily pass on to a friend or family member who might need to care for your pet if you become ill during COVID-19. Include the following in your list:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Food, water, litter, and treats for two weeks</li>
                <li>Any drugs your pet is on, as well as how to administer them</li>
                <li>Vaccination records and medical history of your pet</li>
                <li>Any emergency contacts and your pet's veterinarian's contact information</li>
                <li>Copy of your pet's registration, adoption papers, or microchip certificate as proof of ownership</li>
                <li>Recent images of your pet to disseminate in the event that your pet becomes separated from you.</li>           <li>Comfy bedding or pet blankets</li>
                <li>Grooming tools and brushes</li>
                <li>Some of my favorite toys</li>
                <li>To travel your pet, you'll need a crate or carrier.</li>
                <li>a second collar or harness, as well as a leash</li>
                <li>A pet first aid kid</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Taking care of your pet during a coronavirus outbreak:</h2>
            <h3>Veterinary consultations:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Rescheduled routine appointments will help you avoid unnecessary veterinary visits.</li>
                <li>If your pet need medical attention, speak with your veterinarian about your alternatives.</li>
                <li>To assist reduce contact, many veterinary offices now provide curbside service.</li>
                <li>When it comes to emergency care, be sure you're familiar with your veterinarian's procedures.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Play and exercise:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Maintain as much consistency as possible in your pet's routine.</li>

                <li>If you can't get outside, try to find methods to keep your pet active by playing new games and activities inside.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Feeding and general care:</h3>
            <p>Above all, continue to love and care for your pet as you always have. If you are having financial difficulties as a result of a job loss or other circumstances, there may be pet financial assistance available. You can also contact a local animal shelter or animal welfare organization. During this time, many communities have food banks or pantries to help pets and people in need.</p>
            <h3>What to do if you or a family member becomes ill</h3>
            <p>Consult the most recent CDC recommendations. Make arrangements ahead of time for someone to care for your pet if you become ill, and share your care plan with them. Prepare the supplies your pet will require and make it as simple as possible for your designated caregiver to collect them.</p>
