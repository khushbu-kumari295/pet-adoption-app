# Pet Cafe and Adoption Center

## About
This website is a Single-Page Application named as "Fur-Ever" Paradise that describes about the pet cafe and adoption center that is located in Seattle. Here you can meet with the Residential cats/dogs who are the pet ambassadors, see the pet hours and register to come to the cafe. It also have Adoptable cats and dogs available for adoption. This website also schedules some pet events related to upcoming celebration like Christmas, 5k dog run and yoga with cats.

## Complex UX
### Carousel
Present in the About page and can be reached via clicking the "About" button in Navigation bar. 
It has four sections which display:
1. New Adopters's Checklist
2. Yoga with Cats Event
3. 5K Dog Run Event
4. Petmas Celebration Event

All the carousels sections have navigation to different pages in website. The carousel have transformation used in it to show sliding behavior.
### Accordion 
Present in the FAQ page, reachable by clicking the "Adoption FAQ" in the Navigation bar.
It has two separated sections General and Fostering.


### Form
Form can be reached by clicking on "Plan a visit" in the Navigation bar.
This form has a <strong>changing section</strong> 
- On selecting "Purpose of visit", there are 2 kind of changes. 
    - If you select "Lounge visit" or "Pet Adoption", it will show a control to select date and time for the visit along with the other inputs required like number of persons visiting, pet group etc.
    - If you select events like "Yoga with cats", "5k Dog Run" or "Petmas celebration", it won't ask for date and time since these events are pre-planned.
- The form is storing values in application state.
- The form shows required fields by a red astrick.
- The form shows the validation error after the field is clicked atleast once and the value is incorrect, or when the submit is clicked and values are invalid.
- The Form won't be submitted if there are any validation errors.
- After form submission, the website will re-direct you to a schedules page where you can view your upcoming schedules. You can cancel those schedules as well from that page.

## Loading Indicator
To view the loading Indicator, select either the "Cat" menu or the "Dog" menu, and in the sub-menu, select the "Adoptable" or "Resident" option. This will load the list of Pets available in that category. In this I have used animation to show the spinner while loading the pet data.

Another place where I have added spinner is when the website shows upcoming schedules. This page can be reached via form submission in "Plan a visit" page. 

## Fake services
For fetching the Cats and dogs data, I have created PetResources.js file under the services folder. This will wait for 1 second before returning the data. Another place where I am using service is when user submit the "Plan a vist" form, it calls the service "ScheduleResource.js" which stores the apointment data in global variable. This data is used by /upcoming-schedules page to show the upcoming schedules. 

## Pages
### Navigation pages
#### About
This is the home page and can be reached by click on "About" menu in Navigation bar.
It has menus and submenus and has transformation.
It has complex carousel UI with 4 different views in it that slides to next using transformation.
I have created CSS grid of 3 cards, each going to New Adopters checklist, Covid-19 Resources, and Adoption FAQ.

#### Cats and Dogs
This is the page where I am showing the residential and adoptable Cats and Dogs in CSS grids. The page has interesting facts about adoptable cats and dogs. The interesting facts are present for the adoptable category of pets and you can view them by clicking on "Read more". The data is fetched by calling PetResource service to get the data and show it in the UI. While fetching, it shows a loading spinner which has animation in it.

#### Adoption FAQ
This page shows the common FAQ questions asked. It has a list of accordion in two sets General and Fostering which shows questions and expanding them shows the answers.

#### Plan a visit
This page has the form to schedule an apointment. The fields indicate if they are required or not by the red astrick symbol after the field. The form shows error after the field is touched or the submit it clicked. The Form also changes the field based on the dropdown selection. Once the form is subnitted, it calls a fake service to include the apointment details in the list of apointment and redirects users to /upcoming-schedule page that shows their current apointment. You may cancel the apointment using this page.
